# FullCalendar Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to implement FullCalendar as an alternative to react-big-calendar for the Motive Archive Manager.

## Installation

To implement FullCalendar, you need to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/interaction @fullcalendar/list
```

## File Structure

The implementation consists of:

1. `src/components/calendar/FullCalendar.tsx` - Main component implementation
2. `src/components/calendar/fullcalendar.css` - Styles for FullCalendar
3. `src/components/cars/FullCalendarTab.tsx` - Component to use in the cars page

## Usage

To use FullCalendar instead of the current react-big-calendar implementation:

### Option 1: Update the Cars Page to use FullCalendarTab

```tsx
// In src/app/cars/[id]/page.tsx
import FullCalendarTab from "@/components/cars/FullCalendarTab";

// Replace the CalendarTab with FullCalendarTab
{
  value: "calendar",
  label: "Calendar",
  content: <FullCalendarTab carId={id} />,
}
```

### Option 2: Replace the MotiveCalendar Implementation

Replace the contents of the BaseCalendar and MotiveCalendar components with the FullCalendar implementation.

## Advantages of FullCalendar

FullCalendar offers several advantages over react-big-calendar:

1. **Consistent View Rendering:** FullCalendar's week and month views have consistent rendering and sizing, avoiding the alignment issues with react-big-calendar.
2. **Better Default Styling:** Requires less CSS customization to achieve a professional look.
3. **More Feature-Rich:** Includes features like:
   - Timeline views
   - Resource scheduling
   - Better drag-and-drop
   - More customization options
4. **Responsive by Default:** Better handling of different screen sizes.

5. **Active Maintenance:** FullCalendar is actively maintained with regular updates.

## Known Issues

There are a few TypeScript linter errors due to dynamic imports. These won't affect functionality but should be addressed for production code by:

1. Adding proper type definitions for dynamically imported components
2. Installing TypeScript types for FullCalendar packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/fullcalendar
```

## CSS Customization

The CSS in `fullcalendar.css` is designed to match the existing theme of the application. You may need to adjust:

- Color variables to match your theme
- Height calculations based on your layout
- Responsive behavior for different screen sizes
