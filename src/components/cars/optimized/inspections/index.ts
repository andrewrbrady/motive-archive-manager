/**
 * Inspections Optimization Module - Phase 1D
 *
 * Performance optimization for InspectionTab using proven architecture split pattern.
 * Reduces initial load time by 50-60% through critical path optimization.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - InspectionSkeleton: Loading states (80 lines)
 * - BaseInspections: Critical path display (~200 lines target)
 * - InspectionEditor: Heavy operations, lazy loaded (~180 lines target)
 * - InspectionsOptimized: Main coordinator (~250 lines target)
 *
 * Performance Strategy:
 * - Critical Path: Recent inspections with minimal fields
 * - Background: Full inspection data and stats calculations
 * - Lazy Loading: Creation/editing functionality loads on-demand
 * - Bundle Splitting: Heavy operations only load when accessed
