# Node.js Configuration Rules

## Development Server

- DO NOT run `npm run dev` as the user already has it running in a separate window
- For testing changes, rely on the user's existing development server
- Focus on making code changes without attempting to restart the server

## Build Process

- Use `npm run build` only when explicitly requested
- Prefer making changes to the codebase without rebuilding

## Dependencies

- When adding new dependencies, use `npm install --save` for runtime dependencies
- Use `npm install --save-dev` for development dependencies
- Always specify exact versions when suggesting new dependencies
