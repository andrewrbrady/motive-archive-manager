# Next.js Router Migration: Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Initial Audit and Assessment**

   - Analyzed current routing structure
   - Identified Pages Router files still in use (`_document.tsx` and `/api/upload.ts`)
   - Determined impact of migration on existing functionality
   - Created inventory of all components dependent on Pages Router endpoints

2. **API Route Migration**

   - Created new App Router upload endpoint at `/app/api/upload/route.ts`
   - Implemented file upload handling using Next.js formData API
   - Ensured response format matches the original API for compatibility
   - Improved implementation with modern async/await patterns
   - Removed the Pages Router version of the upload endpoint

3. **Document Configuration Migration**

   - Verified `_document.tsx` has no special customizations
   - Confirmed App Router's `layout.tsx` includes all necessary functionality
   - Removed `_document.tsx` after verification
   - Documented differences and improvements in layout configuration

4. **Cloudflare Library Updates**

   - Enhanced `uploadToCloudflare` function with better error handling and logging
   - Updated `StudioInventoryGrid` component to use the improved function
   - Updated `EditInventoryItemModal` to use the improved function
   - Updated `AddInventoryItemModal` to use the improved function
   - Updated `BatchImageUploadModal` to use the improved function

5. **Cleanup**

   - Removed all Pages Router files
   - Removed the entire `/pages` directory
   - Resolved routing conflicts between Pages Router and App Router

6. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive migration guide at `docs/router-migration.md`
   - Created testing guide at `docs/upload-endpoint-testing.md`
   - Documented the migration strategy and implementation details
   - Added best practices for future App Router development

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**

   - Test all components that use image uploads:
     - StudioInventoryGrid
     - EditInventoryItemModal
     - AddInventoryItemModal
     - BatchImageUploadModal
   - Fix any issues discovered during testing

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review App Router implementation for best practices
   - Implement route grouping for better organization
   - Add proper loading and error states for all routes

## Next Steps

1. Test all file upload functionality thoroughly
2. Implement performance optimizations for the App Router
3. Add loading states and error boundaries to improve user experience
