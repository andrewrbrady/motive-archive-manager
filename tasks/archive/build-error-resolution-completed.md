# ✅ Build Error Resolution - COMPLETED

**Date:** $(date)  
**Error Category:** TypeScript/Type Check Failure

## 🚧 Original Issue

- **File:** `src/components/galleries/BatchCanvasExtensionModal.tsx`
- **Line:** 246
- **Error:** `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0. 'new' expression, whose target lacks a construct signature, implicitly has an 'any' type.`

## 🔧 Root Cause

The global `Image` constructor was not available in the Node.js build environment. During SSR/build time, `new Image()` fails because it's a browser-only API.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Fixed by:

1. Adding environment checking: `if (typeof window === 'undefined')`
2. Using proper browser Image constructor: `new window.Image()`
3. Graceful error handling for non-browser environments

**Code Change:**

```typescript
// Before:
const img = new Image();

// After:
if (typeof window === "undefined") {
  reject(new Error("Not in browser environment"));
  return;
}
const img = new window.Image();
```

## 🎯 Resolution Steps Completed

- [x] Identified the error type: TypeScript/Type Check Failure
- [x] Located the problematic code in BatchCanvasExtensionModal.tsx line 246
- [x] Applied fix with proper environment checking
- [x] Re-ran build - **SUCCESS** ✅
- [x] Logged error and resolution in `/logs/latest-build-error.log`
- [x] Logged success in `/logs/build-success.log`

## 📊 Build Results

- **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Build Time:** ~30 seconds
- **Warnings:** Only ESLint warnings for console.log statements and React Hook dependencies (non-blocking)
- **Total Routes:** 136 static pages generated successfully

## 📝 Notes

The build now passes successfully with only non-blocking ESLint warnings. The Image constructor issue was the only blocking error preventing the build from completing.
