# Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL: NO BUILD COMMANDS
**NEVER EVER run any build, dev, or deployment commands without explicit user permission:**
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev` 
- `npm start`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn dev`
- `vercel build`
- `vercel deploy`
- `next build`
- `next dev`
- Any other build/dev/deployment commands

**This is MANDATORY. Do not run these commands even to "test" or "check for errors".**

## General Rules
Do not run development server commands like "npm run dev" or "npm run build" or "vercel build" unless explicitly given permission.
