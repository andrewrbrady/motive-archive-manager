When working with Node.js in this project:

1. Always use Node 20 from Homebrew on macOS with the correct PATH:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"
   ```

2. Development environment:
   
   - The development server (`npm run dev`) will always be running in a separate window
   - IMPORTANT: AI assistants must NEVER attempt to start the development server with any command
   - The user manages the development server independently
   - AI assistants should focus on code changes only, not server management
   - The user will provide feedback from their running development server when needed

3. For production builds:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Always run a build before deploying to git

5. Ensure Homebrew is properly configured:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   ```
