When working with Node.js in this project:

1. Always use Node 20 from Homebrew on macOS with the correct PATH:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"
   ```

2. For development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. For production builds:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Always run a build before deploying to git

5. Ensure Homebrew is properly configured:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   ```
