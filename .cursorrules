## USING NODE

this is how to properly run node and npm on macos

export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH" && node --version && npm run build

## WORKING WITH MODELS

DO NOT OVERWRITE MY MODEL CHOICES:

DO NOT USE gpt-4-vision-preview, use gpt-4o-mini instead.

When using Anthropic APIs, use claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

### building and deploying

always run a buildd before deploying to git

### styling

we need to use a monochrome color palette for the website.

## Styling Guidelines

Please follow the comprehensive styling guide located in docs/STYLING.md. This guide defines our dark-mode-first approach, color palette, typography, spacing, and component styling.

Key points:

1. Use the defined color variables for consistency
2. Follow the dark-mode-first philosophy
3. Maintain accessibility standards
4. Use Tailwind utility classes when possible
5. Keep components modular and reusable
