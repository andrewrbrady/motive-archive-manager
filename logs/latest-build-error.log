Build Error Log - $(date)

Error Type: TypeScript/Type Check Failure
File: src/components/galleries/BatchCanvasExtensionModal.tsx
Line: 246
Error: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0. 'new' expression, whose target lacks a construct signature, implicitly has an 'any' type.

Code Context:
```
244 |       try {
245 |         await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
246 |           const img = new Image();
247 |           img.onload = () => {
248 |             resolve();
249 |           };
```

Root Cause: 
The global `Image` constructor is not available in the Node.js build environment. 
In browser environments, `new Image()` works, but during SSR/build, it needs to be `new window.Image()` or proper environment checking.

Next Steps:
1. Fix the Image constructor usage
2. Add proper environment checking 
3. Re-run build to verify fix
