## Recent Updates

### Next.js 15 Compatibility Fix (January 2025)

**Problem**: Next.js 15 changed `params` from a direct object to a Promise, causing runtime errors when accessing `params.id` directly.

**Solution**: Updated all affected files to properly handle Promise-based params:

1. **Frontend (`src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`)**:

   - Added `use` import from React
   - Changed params type to `Promise<{ id: string }>`
   - Used `React.use(params)` to unwrap the Promise
   - Updated all references to use resolved params

2. **API Routes** (all `/api/projects/[id]/*` endpoints):
   - Changed params type to `Promise<{ id: string }>`
   - Used `await params` to unwrap the Promise
   - Updated all references to use destructured id

**Files Updated**:

- `src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/timeline/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/team/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/assets/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/budget/route.ts`

**Result**: All project-related pages and API endpoints now work correctly with Next.js 15.
