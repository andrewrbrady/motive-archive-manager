## Recent Updates

### Component Architecture Refactoring (January 2025)

**Problem**: The main project detail page component had grown to 993 lines (down from 3,226 after initial refactoring) but still contained all business logic for every tab, making it difficult to maintain and test.

**Solution**: Moved all applicable business logic functions into their respective individual components:

1. **ProjectOverviewTab.tsx**:

   - Moved `handleAddExpense` and `handleRemoveExpense` functions
   - Added internal state management for expense forms
   - Integrated toast notifications and error handling
   - Enhanced expense display with hover-to-delete functionality

2. **ProjectTimelineTab.tsx**:

   - Moved `handleToggleMilestone`, `handleAddMilestone`, and `handleUpdateMilestone` functions
   - Added internal state management for milestone forms and calendar
   - Integrated custom calendar picker and form validation
   - Added milestone editing functionality with click-to-edit

3. **ProjectTeamTab.tsx**:

   - Moved `handleAddMember`, `handleRemoveMember`, and `handleUpdateMemberRole` functions
   - Added `fetchAvailableUsers` function with Firestore integration
   - Implemented custom user dropdown to avoid event bubbling issues
   - Added role-based permission management

4. **ProjectAssetsTab.tsx**:

   - Moved `handleAddAsset` and `handleRemoveAsset` functions
   - Added internal state management for asset forms
   - Integrated asset type management and validation
   - Enhanced visual organization with type-specific icons

5. **ProjectDeliverablesTab.tsx**:

   - Moved all deliverable management functions including `handleAddDeliverable`, `handleLinkExistingDeliverables`, `handleUpdateDeliverableStatus`, and `handleRemoveDeliverable`
   - Added `fetchProjectDeliverables` and `fetchExistingDeliverables` functions
   - Implemented complete deliverable workflow management
   - Added internal state management for all deliverable operations

6. **ProjectTabs.tsx**:

   - Simplified to only handle tab navigation and content rendering
   - Reduced props from 15+ functions to single `onProjectUpdate` callback
   - Cleaner interface with better type safety

7. **Main Page Component** (`page.tsx`):
   - Removed all business logic functions (500+ lines of code)
   - Simplified to focus on authentication, routing, and high-level data fetching
   - Provides single `fetchProject` function as `onProjectUpdate` callback
   - Maintains tab navigation and member details state

**Technical Achievements**:

- Reduced main component complexity by moving 500+ lines of business logic
- Eliminated prop drilling of 15+ function props through component layers
- Each component now manages its own state, forms, and API calls
- Improved error handling and loading states at component level
- Enhanced code reusability and testability
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving architecture

**Files Updated**:

- `src/components/projects/ProjectOverviewTab.tsx` - Added expense management
- `src/components/projects/ProjectTimelineTab.tsx` - Added milestone management
- `src/components/projects/ProjectTeamTab.tsx` - Added team management
- `src/components/projects/ProjectAssetsTab.tsx` - Added asset management
- `src/components/projects/ProjectDeliverablesTab.tsx` - Added deliverable management
- `src/components/projects/ProjectTabs.tsx` - Simplified props interface
- `src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed business logic, simplified structure

**Result**: The project detail page now follows proper React component architecture with clear separation of concerns, making it much more maintainable and scalable.
