## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Design

```typescript
interface Inspection {
  _id: ObjectId;
  carId: ObjectId;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: "pass" | "needs_attention";
  inspectionImageIds: string[]; // Cloudflare image IDs - stored only on inspection
  dropboxVideoFolderUrl?: string;
  dropboxImageFolderUrl?: string;
  checklistItems: Array<{
    id: string;
    description: string;
    completed: boolean;
    dateCompleted?: Date;
  }>;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  inspectedBy?: string; // User ID or name
}

// Note: Car model no longer has inspectionImageIds field
// Images are managed exclusively within inspection objects
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/cars/[carId]/inspections`
- `POST /api/cars/[carId]/inspections`
- `GET /api/inspections/[inspectionId]`
- `PUT /api/inspections/[inspectionId]`
- `DELETE /api/inspections/[inspectionId]`
- `POST /api/inspections/[inspectionId]/email`

### Email Integration

- Use existing SendGrid setup from `src/lib/email.ts`
- Create inspection report email template
- Include inspection images and details in email

## Next Steps

1. Test the basic functionality with the existing implementation
2. Add image upload functionality to the inspection form
3. Enhance the checklist management features
4. Polish the UI and add better error handling
