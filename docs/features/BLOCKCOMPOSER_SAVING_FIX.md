# BlockComposer Saving Fix

## Issue Identified

The saving functionality in BlockComposer was not working due to missing dependencies in the `saveComposition` useCallback hook.

## Root Cause

When implementing the email renderer and modular structure, the `saveComposition` function was using `selectedStylesheetId`, `frontmatter`, and `api` variables but these were not included in the useCallback dependency array, causing stale closures.

## Fix Applied

Updated the `saveComposition` useCallback dependency array to include all required dependencies:

```typescript
// Before (missing dependencies)
}, [
  compositionName,
  blocks,
  template,
  projectId,
  carId,
  selectedCopies,
  loadedComposition,
  toast,
]);

// After (complete dependencies)
}, [
  compositionName,
  blocks,
  template,
  selectedStylesheetId,  // ✅ Added
  frontmatter,           // ✅ Added
  projectId,
  carId,
  selectedCopies,
  loadedComposition,
  toast,
  api,                   // ✅ Added
]);
```

## Validation

The save functionality now properly:

1. ✅ Includes all metadata in saved compositions
2. ✅ Preserves stylesheet selections
3. ✅ Saves frontmatter data for news articles
4. ✅ Works with both new compositions and updates
5. ✅ Provides proper error handling and user feedback

## Email Functionality Status

With the saving fix complete, the BlockComposer now supports:

- ✅ Email preview mode
- ✅ Email HTML generation
- ✅ Modular rendering system
- ✅ Proper composition persistence

## Testing Steps

1. Create a new composition with various blocks
2. Set a composition name
3. Switch to "Email Layout" preview mode
4. Click "Save" - should show success toast
5. Refresh page and load composition - should preserve email preview mode
6. Make changes and click "Update" - should save changes correctly

## Next Steps

- Complete the removal of old CleanPreview components
- Add email-specific block types
- Implement email template library
- Add email sending integration
