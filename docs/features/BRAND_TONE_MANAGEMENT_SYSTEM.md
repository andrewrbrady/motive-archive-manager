```

The test covers:

- Public endpoint access (no auth required)
- Admin endpoint security (auth required)
- CRUD operation validation
- Error handling verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Access admin panel → Brand Tones tab
- [ ] Create new brand tone with all fields
- [ ] Edit existing brand tone
- [ ] Toggle active/inactive status
- [ ] Delete brand tone (with confirmation)
- [ ] Validate form field requirements
- [ ] Test duplicate name prevention
- [ ] Verify example phrases management

## Sample Brand Tones

Here are example brand tones to create for testing:

### 1. Professional

- **Description**: Formal business communication
- **Instructions**: "Write in a formal, business-like manner. Use proper grammar, avoid casual language, and focus on expertise and reliability."

- **Instructions**: "Focus on technical specifications, performance metrics, and engineering excellence. Use precise, technical language."
- **Examples**: ["Peak performance", "Engineering precision", "Track-tested excellence"]

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is complete. Phase 2 will integrate brand tones into the copywriter:

1. **Copywriter Integration**

   - Add brand tone selector to copywriter UI
   - Integrate tone instructions into AI prompts
   - Update existing copywriter components

2. **Enhanced Features**

   - Brand tone templates
   - Usage analytics
   - Import/export functionality
   - Version history

3. **Advanced Settings**
   - Platform-specific tones
   - Client-specific brand tones
   - Tone combination rules
