**Status**: ✅ Already working correctly

- Handles both database-only and database+storage deletion
- Supports batch deletion of multiple images
- Proper transaction handling with MongoDB
- Cloudflare API integration for storage deletion
- Comprehensive error handling

### Existing useDeleteImages Hook

**Location**: `src/lib/hooks/query/useImages.ts`

**Status**: ✅ Already working correctly

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Batch Deletion Testing

- [ ] Enter edit mode by adding `?mode=edit` to URL
- [ ] Select multiple images by clicking on them
- [ ] Verify EditModeControls appears with correct count
- [ ] Test "Clear Selection" button
- [ ] Test "Delete Selected" with "Database Only" option
- [ ] Test "Delete Selected" with "Database + Storage" option
- [ ] Verify gallery refreshes after deletion
- [ ] Verify deleted images are removed from view

#### Individual Deletion Testing

- [ ] Hover over image thumbnail (non-edit mode)
- [ ] Verify dropdown menu appears
- [ ] Test "Delete Image" option
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Test both deletion options
- [ ] Verify image is removed after deletion
- [ ] Test deletion of current image (should switch to next image)

#### Edit Mode Quick Delete Testing

- [ ] Enter edit mode
- [ ] Hover over image thumbnail
- [ ] Verify quick delete button appears
- [ ] Test quick delete functionality
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog works

#### Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Test deletion with network disconnected
- [ ] Test deletion with invalid image IDs
- [ ] Verify error messages are displayed
- [ ] Verify gallery state is maintained on errors

### API Testing

```bash
# Test batch deletion (database only)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/cars/[carId]/images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageIds": ["imageId1", "imageId2"], "deleteFromStorage": false}'

# Test batch deletion (database + storage)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/cars/[carId]/images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageIds": ["imageId1", "imageId2"], "deleteFromStorage": true}'
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- ✅ All deletion operations require authentication
- ✅ User must be authorized to modify the specific car
- ✅ API endpoints validate user permissions

### Data Safety

- ✅ Two-tier deletion system prevents accidental permanent deletion
- ✅ Database-only deletion allows recovery of files
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletion
- ✅ Transaction-based deletion ensures data consistency

### Error Handling

- ✅ Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Rollback functionality for failed operations
- ✅ Proper logging for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Optimistic Updates

- ✅ UI updates immediately for better perceived performance
- ✅ Rollback on errors to maintain consistency
- ✅ Cache invalidation after successful deletion

### Batch Operations

- ✅ Efficient batch deletion for multiple images
- ✅ Single API call for multiple image deletion
- ✅ Minimal UI re-renders during deletion

### Memory Management

- ✅ Proper cleanup of selected images state
- ✅ Cache management to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Efficient re-rendering with React.memo

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- [ ] Undo functionality for database-only deletions
- [ ] Bulk actions (select all, select none)
- [ ] Drag and drop for batch selection
- [ ] Progress indicators for large batch deletions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for deletion actions

### Analytics

- [ ] Track deletion patterns for UX improvements
