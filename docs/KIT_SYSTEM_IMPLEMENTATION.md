- [ ] Test kit checkout and checkin process
- [ ] Test kit deletion and item availability updates
- [ ] Validate proper database updates

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the Kits tab into the main application
2. Update the studio inventory API to handle kit-related queries
3. Test the complete kit system workflow
4. Add kit filtering and search functionality
5. Implement kit templates and duplication features

## 1. Data Model Enhancements

- [x] Review current Kit interface in `src/types/inventory.ts`
- [x] Enhance Kit interface with additional properties:
  - [x] Add `status` field with possible values: "available", "checked-out", "maintenance"
  - [x] Add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
  - [x] Add `createdBy` field to track who created the kit
  - [x] Add `checkedOutTo` and related checkout fields
  - [x] Add `checkoutHistory` array to track kit usage
- [ ] Create a MongoDB schema for kits collection
- [ ] Define relationship between kits and inventory items
- [ ] Add `kit_status` field to inventory items to track their status within kits

## 2. Backend API Development

- [x] Create base API endpoints for kit management:
  - [x] `GET /api/kits` - List all kits
  - [x] `POST /api/kits` - Create a new kit
- [x] Complete remaining API endpoints:
  - [x] `GET /api/kits/:id` - Get a specific kit
  - [x] `PUT /api/kits/:id` - Update a kit
  - [x] `DELETE /api/kits/:id` - Delete a kit
  - [x] `POST /api/kits/:id/checkout` - Check out a kit
  - [x] `POST /api/kits/:id/checkin` - Check in a kit
- [ ] Implement logic to handle item status when added to/removed from kits
- [ ] Create batch operations for kit items
- [ ] Add validation to prevent conflicts (e.g., adding checked-out items to kits)

## 3. Frontend Components

- [x] Create/enhance kit-related components:
  - [x] Improve `CreateKitModal` to support enhanced kit properties
  - [x] Create `KitsList` component for displaying kits in a spreadsheet format
  - [x] Create `KitDetailView` component for viewing kit details
  - [x] Create `EditKitModal` for modifying existing kits
  - [x] Create `KitCheckoutModal` for checking out entire kits
- [x] Update `StudioInventoryTab` to properly handle kit operations
- [ ] Add kit filtering and sorting capabilities

## 4. State Management

- [x] Update state management for kits in `StudioInventoryTab`
- [x] Implement proper fetching and caching of kits data
- [x] Create state for kit filtering and sorting
- [x] Handle kit availability status updates
- [x] Implement optimistic updates for better UX

## 5. UI/UX Improvements

- [x] Design and implement the Kits tab view
- [ ] Create visual indicators for items that are part of kits
- [ ] Implement kit filtering options
- [x] Add kit search functionality
- [x] Create kit status badges and indicators
- [x] Design kit detail view with item listing
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop functionality for kit item management (optional)

## 6. Item Status Management

- [ ] Create a new status for items in kits: "in-kit"
- [ ] Update item availability logic to account for kit membership
- [ ] Implement rules for when items can be added to or removed from kits
- [ ] Handle conflicts between individual checkout and kit membership
- [ ] Add validation to prevent invalid state transitions

## 7. Kit Checkout System

- [x] Implement kit checkout workflow
- [x] Create kit check-in process
- [ ] Add validation to prevent checking out kits with unavailable items
- [x] Track kit checkout history
- [ ] Add ability to partially check in kits (optional)
- [ ] Implement kit reservation system (optional)

## 8. Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for kit-related API endpoints
- [ ] Test kit creation, modification, and deletion
- [ ] Test kit checkout and check-in processes
- [ ] Verify correct item status updates when added to/removed from kits
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

## 9. Documentation

- [ ] Document kit-related API endpoints
- [ ] Create user documentation for kit management
- [ ] Update code comments for kit-related functions
- [ ] Create diagrams showing kit-item relationships

## 10. Deployment

- [ ] Deploy database schema changes
- [ ] Roll out new API endpoints
- [ ] Deploy frontend changes
- [ ] Monitor for any issues after deployment
- [ ] Gather user feedback and plan improvements

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Tasks

- Enhanced Kit interface in `src/types/inventory.ts` with additional properties
- Created base API endpoints for kit management (GET and POST)
- Created API endpoints for individual kit operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Created API endpoints for kit checkout/checkin operations
- Created frontend components for kit management (KitsList, CreateKitModal, KitDetailsModal, KitCheckoutModal)
- Integrated the Kits tab into the StudioInventoryTab component
- Implemented kit checkout/checkin functionality with validation

### In Progress

- Updating item status management for kits
- Testing the complete kit system workflow

### Next Steps

1. Update the studio inventory API to handle kit-related queries
2. Test the complete kit system workflow
3. Add kit filtering and search functionality
4. Implement kit templates and duplication features

## Notes and Considerations

- Consider how to handle items that are part of multiple kits (if allowed)
- Decide on a strategy for kit versioning (if needed)
- Plan for kit templates to quickly create standard kits
- Consider integration with reporting system for kit usage analytics
- Evaluate performance implications of kit operations on large inventories
